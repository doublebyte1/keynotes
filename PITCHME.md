## Introduction

+ Micro-company, based in the NL
+ Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI)
+ FOSS

## SDI

![team](assets/sdi.png)

<!-- data infrastructure implementing a framework of geographic data, metadata, users and tools that are interactively connected in order to use spatial data in an efficient and flexible way
 -->

## Why Docker?

- Automation  |
- Portability |
- Scalability |

<!--
Infrastructure as code
Build once, ship anywhere
- Rapid deployment
- Portability across machines
- Modularity
-->

## SDI

## SDI as-a-Service
- Create and manage customer orders
- Deploy and mananage servers
- Transform software assets into images
- Deploy and manage orchestrations
- Link customer orders to servers/orchestrations

## Why Microservices?
- Isolation |
- Simplicity |

<!--
A failure of a component does not affect the entire System
easier upgrades; we can combine multiple technologies
Its easier to understand single components; scalability

Microservices is an architecture which breaks large software projects into loosely coupled modules, which communicate with each other through REST APIs.
