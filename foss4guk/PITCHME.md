## Virtualization

*The thin piece of software that decouples the OS from the physical bare-metal, and allows us to hedge physical hardware.*
<p style="text-align:right;">IBM, 1967</p>

<!--
- Run an OS on top of another OS.
- Shared hardware resources.
- More efficient use of resources.
-->

<!--
scalability, cloud, automation, Reproduceabiliy
-->
- Take an image of an entire virtual host and launch a new virtual instance from it.

## Hypervisor Based Virtualization
<!--
- Hardware virtualization
- OS agnostic
- Hypervisor sits between the OS and the physical hardware.
-  performance hit:  memory and cpu managers for a guest operating system and hypervisor
good for virtulizing servers, but do we really want to use it to virtualize software?

## Container Based Virtualization
<!--
- Software virtualization, done at OS level
- Each container(well call it guest operating system) shares the same kernel of the base system.
- provides isolation, but not as much as hypervisor Based
- it needs to run in linux
- is much more lightweight
- The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly[10] isolates an application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting, including the CPU, memory, block I/O, and network.

trust
model presumes that the local
government agencies of counties and municipalities
will share their geographic information freely with
government agencies of regions, states and federal
agencies.

In a phenomenon known widely as vertical
integration (Burgess 1999), the detailed information
collected by local agencies should be available to
agencies operating at other levels of government,
ensuring the most complete geographic information
possible

Through the European Commission INSPIRE Directive (European Commission 2007), transposed into national legislation of member states in 2009 (cf. Scottish Government 2009), all European Union countries are required to share environmentally related datasets so that they can be easily accessed by other public organisations within their own and neighbouring countries for the purposes of Community environmental policies and policies or activities that may have an impact on the environment. There is thus an increasing expectation that publicly held data should be available, without undue restriction, to inform decision making about the environment. If the data are not discoverable and accessible they cannot be easily considered alongside other relevant datasets and help positively influence decision-making processes until far too late.

Key to delivering INSPIRE is the establishment of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). An SDI provides the framework for coordinating the policies, infrastructure and standards needed to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain and preserve spatial data to deliver GI enabled business applications and services for social, economic and environmental benefits. Although INSPIRE mandates a national approach, SDIs may also be established regionally or thematically. E
